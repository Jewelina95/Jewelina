  It is well documented that exergames are enjoyable to play and can significantly improve older adults’ health and well-being. However, there is limited research on exploring factors affecting these users’ acceptance of such games, especially in virtual reality (VR), a relatively newer technology. This study proposes an extended version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). We use variables from TAM related to older Chinese adults and specific to VR exergames to explore and confirm critical factors that could influence these users’ acceptance of such games in VR. We tested the proposed model with 51 older Chinese adults (aged 65 and above) after playing three
  commercial VR exergames (Beat Saber, FitXR, Dance Central). Results show that these older adults who are younger and retired and have a higher education, better financial means, and a good health condition have a more positive view of VR exergames. In addition, Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, and Perceived Enjoyment positively affect the intention to play VR exergames. Self-Satisfaction has a positive impact on Perceived Ease of Use and Perceived Usefulness. However, unlike previous  studies, our results suggest that Facilitating Conditions have a negative effect on Perceived Ease of Use. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and practical implications of
  our results.
