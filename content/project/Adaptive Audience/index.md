  In VR fitness games, the appearance of non-player characters (NPCs) is very widespread and is used to enhance gameplay experiences.
  Previous research has revealed that NPC spectators' feedback and reactions could improve players' performance, experience, and exertion. Additionally, research has shown that the size, nature, and volume of the NPC's feedback could vary the impact on player performance.

  We proposed an adaptive user interface that could enable NPCs to change their feedback dynamically, e.g., different actions, different feedback volumes, and different broadcasting impressions to design an effective and enjoyable user interface in exergames.
